Abstract:

The National Weather Service (NWS) estimates that their open data supports a $1.5 billion industry.
Most of the apps and services from that industry are thin wrappers for open data augmented by a careful expert analysis.

Instead of relying on apps developed by others,
Python enthusiasts can create their own customized weather apps,
leveraging the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards,
NOAA's open data, and Jupyter widgets.
In this talk we will walk through all the steps necessary to create a full-featured interactive mapping app (mobile friendly too!) using Jupyter notebooks and widgets.

More specifically we will show how to set up a data discovery system based on time,
location, and variable of interest (e.g.: wave height),
and demonstrate use of web services for search and data access to fetch environmental sensor data along a hurricane track.

Summary (100 words):

Leveraging the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, NOAA's open data,
and Jupyter widgets we'll demonstrate how set up a data discovery system based on time,
location, and variable of interest (e.g.: wave height).
The goal is to walk through all the steps necessary to create a fully-featured GIS interactive map (mobile friendly too!) using Jupyter notebooks and widgets.

It was the year 1860. Robert FitzRoy, of England and New Zealand,
was using the new telegraph system to gather daily weather observations and produce the first synoptic weather map.
He coined the term “weather forecast” and his were the first ever to be published daily.


When you talk about CSW, I always like to emphasize that you can chain complex queries like a bunch of OR statements (eg standard names) with bunch or AND statements and NOT
And also query service type

Also could mention that catalog search only works effectively if community standards exist

And if multiple communities exist, semantics may be needed

But IOOs doesn’t need that
